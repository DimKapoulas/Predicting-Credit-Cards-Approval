    "## 1. Credit card applications\n",
    "<p>Many people want to get a credit card but consequently not everyone is going to get one and that is because every bank in the world receives <em>tons</em> of applications for credit cards, so inevitably some of them probaly won't be approved. There is an  approval evaluation performed on these applications on the basis of many criteria like income, debts etc because banks need to assess the chances that an owner of a credit card may not manage to repay the debit. Nowdays the whole proccess of a evaluation is automated, due to the huge amount of data, and this is where tools like machine learning models come in handy.</p>\n",
    "<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_558/img/credit_card.jpg\" alt=\"Credit card being held in hand\"></p>\n",
    "<p>So here we are going to build a model for credit card approval, using the <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. With that in mind:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>First things first, we'll load our database and have a first inspection of its characteristics.</li>\n",
    "<li>Since it is a real world dataset we will notice that it has its own \"flaws\". We are faced with many different features (as for their range and type), lots of missing values etc etc.</li>\n",
    "<li>These \"flaws\" create the need for the data to be preproccessed. We need to tidy things up cause \"good data = valid predictions V.S  bad data =  non-valid predictions\". Of course our machine learning model (actually our  employer, but I'll leave this \"one\" out for now) will appreciate us only if we aim for the \"(good = valid)\" pair.</li>\n",
    "<li>After cleaning up, we'll make some exploration and try to derive some first intuitions.</li>\n",
    "<li>Finally, we will build a machine learning model to make prediction on whether or not, an application for credit card would be approved.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>So let's grab our data and have a first look. Take notice that we are dealing with sensitive/confidential data so the provider of this data has already taken care of providing anonymity to the features, which is somehting that complies with GDPR regulations. That means that we are going to find that  \"this\" feature(s) (e.g feature named \"g.1\") might influence the prediction but we won't know if \"this\" feature is income or debt or something else, this is something that the bank that collected the data knows and it is confidential.</p>"

Specifically, out of 690 instances, there are 383 (55.5%) applications that got denied and 307 (44.5%) applications that got approved.</p>\n",
    "<p>This gives us a benchmark. A good machine learning model should be able to accurately predict the status of the applications with respect to these statistics.</p>\n",
    "<p>Now we are faced with the problem of picking an efficient model. One of the most significant factors is the notion <em>if any of the features corellate to each other, affecting the prediction</em>. At this point we will trust our intuition/common sense that there is indeed a correlation. We could validate this assumption by statistically computing the correlation though in the context of this specific showcasing it is not mandatory. Generalized linear models perform well in cases of existing corellation. Let's start our machine learning modeling with a Logistic Regression model (a generalized linear model).
